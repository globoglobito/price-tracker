## Troubleshooting

If tests fail:

1. **MicroK8s not running**: `microk8s start`
2. **Deployment not ready**: `./scripts/deploy.sh`
3. **Pods not running**: `kubectl get pods -n price-tracker`
4. **Database issues**: Check secrets and deployment logs

## Prerequisites

- MicroK8s installed and running
- Infrastructure deployed (`./scripts/deploy.sh`)
- kubectl configured for MicroK8s
